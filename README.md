# VI-Tooltips: Enhanced Tooltip Accessibility

Install it with [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/vi-tooltips)

VI-Tooltips improves World of Warcraft's tooltip system by duplicating tooltips and centering them on your screen. Key features include:

*   **Zoom Tooltips**: Use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out for better readability.
*   **Lock Tooltips**: Lock the duplicated tooltip in place (default key: F6).
*   **Toggle Tooltip**: Hide or show the duplicated tooltip (default key: F7).
*   **Custom Keybinds**: Assign custom keybinds directly through the in-game Keybinds menu or by using a slash command:
    *   **Keybinds Menu**: Open the Keybinds menu and find the VI-Tooltips section to assign keys.
    *   **Slash Command**: Use `/vitooltips KEY1,KEY2` to set custom keys for locking and toggling tooltips.
    *   Example: `/vitooltips F8,F9` binds Lock to F8 and Toggle to F9. _(Note: Lock and Toggle keys must be different.)_
*   **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**: Added the ability to read tooltips aloud using TTS functionality, allowing for improved accessibility. Players can configure the TTS settings such as voice ID, speech rate, and volume via slash commands.
    *   **Slash Command**: `/vitooltipsttsconfig <voiceID> <speechRate> <speechVolume>` to adjust the TTS settings.
    *   Example: `/vitooltipsttsconfig 1 2 100` sets the voice to 1, the speech rate to 2, and the speech volume to 100.
    *   **Limits**:
    *   **Voice ID**: Must be between 1 and 2.
    *   **Speech Rate**: Must be between 0 and 100.
    *   **Speech Volume**: Must be between 0 and 100.
